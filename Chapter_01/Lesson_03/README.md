# Lesson 3 Huawei’s AI strategy & open AI capabilities from Huawei Cloud EI
Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. is a leading global provider of information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure and smart devices. Founded in 1987 by Ren Zhengfei in Shenzhen, China, Huawei has grown into one of the world’s largest tech companies, specializing in telecommunications equipment, consumer electronics, cloud computing, and AI-driven solutions.

The company operates in over 170 countries, advocating for a "fully connected, intelligent world" while navigating complex debates around cybersecurity, digital sovereignty, and technological self-reliance.
