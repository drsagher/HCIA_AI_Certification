# Chapter 1 Introduction to AI & Huawei Strategy
Huawei’s AI strategy in 2025, centered on its "All Intelligence" vision, aims to integrate AI across industries and scenarios through a full-stack, all-scenario portfolio, driving digital transformation in sectors like healthcare, finance, mining, and automotive. The strategy leverages Huawei Cloud’s Enterprise Intelligence (EI) services, including ModelArts for streamlined AI development, MindSpore for high-performance deep learning, CANN for optimized neural network computing, Ascend AI chips (e.g., 910C, 310) for robust hardware, and Atlas for scalable AI infrastructure. These components enable applications like autonomous driving (ADS 3.0), smart mining, and intelligent surveillance, with a focus on device-cloud synergy for real-time processing. Huawei’s open AI capabilities, accessible via Huawei Cloud EI, emphasize open-source contributions like MindSpore, compatibility with frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, and APIs for model integration, fostering developer collaboration. The Pangu models and HiLens platform support multimodal AI, while initiatives like the ICT Competition and $140 million annual R&D investment enhance global talent and innovation. Despite challenges from U.S. sanctions impacting chip yields and regulatory hurdles, Huawei’s open AI ecosystem supports diverse use cases, aligning with global goals like Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030, and positions it as a key competitor to NVIDIA and AWS in the 2025 AI market valued at USD 279.22–391 billion.
