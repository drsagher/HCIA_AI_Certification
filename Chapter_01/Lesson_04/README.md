# Lesson 4 Huawei AI Certification Overview
Huawei’s AI Certification program, part of its "Platform + AI + Ecosystem" strategy, is designed to cultivate skilled AI professionals by providing comprehensive training and validation of expertise in artificial intelligence technologies, aligning with the 2025 global AI market’s growth to USD 279.22–391 billion. The flagship **Huawei Certified ICT Associate – Artificial Intelligence (HCIA-AI V3.0)** certification targets engineers and developers, equipping them with foundational AI knowledge, including machine learning, deep learning, and Huawei’s AI ecosystem (e.g., ModelArts, MindSpore, Ascend chips). The program covers AI history, algorithms, TensorFlow and MindSpore frameworks, and Huawei’s full-stack solutions like the Atlas platform and Huawei Cloud EI, with practical skills in data preprocessing, model building, and deployment for applications like image recognition and autonomous driving. Offered through Huawei Authorized Learning Partners (HALPs) and tested via Pearson VUE, the HCIA-AI exam includes multiple-choice, true/false, and hands-on lab components, with e-certificates issued post-exam. Higher-level certifications like HCIP-AI and HCIE-AI cater to advanced professionals, focusing on complex AI solutions and system optimization. In 2025, Huawei’s ICT Competition engages over 210,000 students globally, fostering talent, but challenges include regional exam restrictions (e.g., China’s OnVUE prohibition) and competition from certifications like AWS Certified Machine Learning.
